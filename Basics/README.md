# Project for Artificial Neural Networks, UPV

In this project I've been working with artificial neural networks with the MNIST and CIFAR10 data. 

- Project_RNA_Olsen.pdf contains project report. 

- MNIST_Olsen.py has code to classify MNIST data using a standard artificial neural network. 

- CIFAR_Olsen.py has code to classify CIFAR10 data using convolutional neural network.
