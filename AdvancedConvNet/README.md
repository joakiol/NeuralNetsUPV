# Project for Computer Vision, UPV

In this project I've been working with advanced architectures for convolutional neural networks with the CIFAR10 and LFW face database. I've also played around a bit with style transfer. 

- CV_report_Olsen.pdf contains project report. 

- task1_cifar10.py has code to classify CIFAR10 data using topologies like ResNet, bottleneckResNet, wideResNet and denseNet. 

- task2_GenderRecognition.py uses same architecture to classify gender from LFW face database. 

- task3_styleTransfer.py has code to perform style transfer.
